# Steps for Setting Up the Repository

## Step 1: Initialize the Repository
- Create a new Git repository or clone an existing one.
- If working with Azure, ensure the repository aligns with Azure best practices by invoking the `azure_development-get_best_practices` tool if available.

## Step 2: Create a Workflow File
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow file in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
- Ensure the workflow file is configured to automate tasks such as testing, building, or deploying your application.
- If applicable, include Azure-specific workflows for integration with Azure DevOps or Azure services.

## Step 3: Commit and Push Changes
- Stage your changes using `git add .`.
- Commit your changes with a meaningful message using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.
- Push your changes to the remote repository using `git push origin <branch-name>`.

## Step 4: Open a Pull Request
- Navigate to the **Pull Requests** tab in your GitHub repository.
- Create a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch.
- Ensure all checks pass before merging the pull request.

## Step 5: Validate the Workflow
- After merging, navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
- Verify that the workflow runs successfully and performs the intended tasks.
- If using Azure, validate that the workflow integrates correctly with Azure services.
