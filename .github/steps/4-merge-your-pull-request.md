# Step 4: Merge your workflow file

_You're now able to write and run an Actions workflow! :sparkles:_

Merging your changes into the `main` branch ensures that the workflow is active and will run for future events triggered in the repository.

## :keyboard: Activity: Merge your workflow file

1. In your repository, click on the **Pull Requests** tab.
2. Locate the pull request you created in Step 1.
3. Click **Merge pull request**, then click **Confirm merge** to merge the changes into the `main` branch.
4. Optionally, click **Delete branch** to delete your `welcome-workflow` branch after merging.
5. After merging, navigate to the **Actions** tab to ensure the workflow runs successfully.

### Notes

- Ensure that all checks have passed before merging the pull request.
- If you're working with Azure, ensure that your workflow aligns with [Azure DevOps best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/best-practices).
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/actions) for troubleshooting.
