# Step 4: Merge your workflow file

_You're now able to write and run an Actions workflow! :sparkles:_

Merge your changes so the action will be a part of the `main` branch.

## :keyboard: Activity: Merge your workflow file

1. In your repository, click on the **Pull requests** tab.
1. Locate the pull request you created in Step 1.
1. Click **Merge pull request**, then click **Confirm merge** to merge the changes into the `main` branch.
1. Optionally, click **Delete branch** to delete your `welcome-workflow` branch after merging.
1. Wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). A new workflow will run and replace the contents of this README file with instructions for the next step.

### Notes:
- Ensure that all checks have passed before merging the pull request.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/actions) for troubleshooting.
